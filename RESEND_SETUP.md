# ðŸš€ Resend Email Setup Guide

Your contact form is now built with shadcn/ui and ready to send emails! You just need to configure Resend.

## Step 1: Get Your Resend API Key

1. **Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)**
2. **Verify your email** and complete account setup
3. **Go to API Keys** in your dashboard
4. **Create a new API key** (give it a name like "Haidee PT Website")
5. **Copy the API key** (it starts with `re_`)

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Create a `.env.local` file** in your project root (if it doesn't exist)
2. **Add all required environment variables**:
```bash
# Resend API Key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here

# Email addresses
HAIDEE_EMAIL=haidee@yourdomain.com
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

**Replace with your actual values:**
- `HAIDEE_EMAIL`: Where contact form submissions will be sent
- `FROM_EMAIL`: The "from" address for emails (must be from your verified domain)

## Step 3: Domain Setup (For Production)

For production use, you'll need to:

1. **Add your domain** in Resend dashboard
2. **Verify DNS records** (Resend will provide instructions)
3. **Update `FROM_EMAIL`** to use your verified domain (e.g., `noreply@yourdomain.com`)

## Step 4: Test Your Form

1. **Start your development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to your contact form**
3. **Fill out and submit the form**
4. **Check your email** for both the notification and thank you emails
